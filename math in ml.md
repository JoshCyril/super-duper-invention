Sample Problem (ML Context)

Problem:
You’re building a model to predict the time (in minutes) it takes to download a file based on internet speed:

Example Problem

Scenario: Suppose you have a dataset of emails labeled as "spam" or "not spam". You find that:

20% of all emails are spam.

50% of spam emails contain the word "discount".

5% of non-spam emails contain the word "discount".


Question: If an email contains "discount", what’s the probability it is spam?

Solution (Bayes’ Theorem):

P(\text{spam}|\text{discount}) = \frac{P(\text{discount}|\text{spam}) \times P(\text{spam})}{P(\text{discount})}

P(\text{discount}) = (0.5 \times 0.2) + (0.05 \times 0.8) = 0.1 + 0.04 = 0.14

P(\text{spam}|\text{discount}) = \frac{0.5 \times 0.2}{0.14} \approx 0.714

If you want, I can move next to 8. Linear Algebra for ML which will tie probability and optimization together in model training.

#8: Optimization

What It Is

Optimization is the mathematical process of finding the "best" solution from a set of possible solutions, according to some criteria. In machine learning, optimization usually means minimizing a loss function (e.g., error between predictions and actual values) or maximizing an objective function (e.g., model accuracy).

Mathematically, it’s often expressed as:

\min_{\theta} L(\theta) \quad \text{or} \quad \max_{\theta} f(\theta)

Where:

 → Model parameters to adjust

 → Loss function

 → Objective function



---

Why It’s Useful in ML

Without optimization, models can’t learn from data. Algorithms like gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, or advanced optimizers (Adam, RMSprop) are essentially ways of navigating the "loss landscape" to find better parameters.

Example uses:

Training neural networks by minimizing cross-entropy loss

SVMs finding the optimal margin between classes

Linear regression minimizing mean squared error



---

Sample Problem

We want to fit a simple linear regression:

y = w x + b

L(w, b) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - (w x_i + b))^2

Using gradient descent:

1. Initialize  and 


2. Compute gradients  and 


3. Update:



w \leftarrow w - \alpha \frac{\partial L}{\partial w}

b \leftarrow b - \alpha \frac{\partial L}{\partial b}  4. Repeat until convergence

If you want, I can next cover #9: Information Theory which is key for understanding concepts like entropy, mutual information, and why decision trees split where they do.

#9: Information Theory

What It Is

Information theory is the mathematical study of information, uncertainty, and compression.
In machine learning, it helps quantify how much "information" a feature provides about a target, or how much uncertainty remains after seeing some data.

Key concepts:

Entropy (H) → Measures uncertainty in a random variable.


H(X) = -\sum_{i} p(x_i) \log_2 p(x_i)

I(X;Y) = H(X) - H(X|Y)

D_{KL}(P \parallel Q) = \sum_i P(i) \log \frac{P(i)}{Q(i)}


---

Why It’s Useful in ML

Feature selection → Pick features that have high mutual information with the target.

Decision tree splitting → Use information gain to choose the best split.

Loss functions → KL divergence is common in probabilistic models and variational autoencoders.

Regularization → Controlling information flow in models prevents overfitting.



---

Sample Problem

Suppose we have a binary classification dataset:

Class (Y)	Probability

Cat	0.5
Dog	0.5


Entropy before seeing any features:

H(Y) = - (0.5 \log_2 0.5 + 0.5 \log_2 0.5) = 1 \ \text{bit}

Now, suppose we see a feature  that perfectly predicts .
Then , and mutual information:

I(X; Y) = H(Y) - H(Y|X) = 1 - 0 = 1 \ \text{bit}


---

Applications

Natural Language Processing → Measure word predictability

Compression algorithms → Huffman coding, Shannon–Fano

Generative models → Variational inference, GAN training

Reinforcement learning → Balancing exploration & exploitation using entropy

10. Linear Algebra for Neural Networks

Linear algebra is the backbone of most machine learning algorithms, especially deep learning, because data is stored and processed as vectors, matrices, and tensors. In neural networks, weights, inputs, and outputs are all represented in this form for efficient computation.


---

Key Concepts

Identity & Inverse Matrices — Important in transformations and solving systems.

Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors — Fundamental in PCA and spectral analysis.

Norms — Measuring vector magnitudes, important in regularization.

Rank — Number of independent rows/columns; affects solvability.

How It’s Used in ML

Forward Propagation: Inputs × Weights = Output.

Backpropagation: Matrix operations compute gradients efficiently.

Dimensionality Reduction: PCA uses eigenvalues/eigenvectors.

Transformations: Rotations, scaling, and projections are matrix operations.

Example

Imagine a simple 2-layer neural network:

Input vector:

x = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}

Weight matrix:

W = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & 0.2 \\ 0.8 & 0.4 \end{bmatrix}

Output:

y = W \cdot x = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5(1) + 0.2(2) \\ 0.8(1) + 0.4(2) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.9 \\ 1.6 \end{bmatrix}

This matrix multiplication is exactly how data moves through neural network layers.

12. Graph Theory for Machine Learning

What It Is

Graph theory studies relationships between objects, where data is represented as nodes (vertices) and edges (links).
In ML, graphs can model:

Social networks (people = nodes, friendships = edges)

Knowledge graphs (entities + relationships)

Biological networks (genes, proteins, etc.)

Web pages (linked by URLs)



---

Key Concepts

Node & Edge – Basic building blocks of a graph.

Adjacency Matrix – Matrix representation of graph connections.

Degree – Number of edges connected to a node.

Path & Cycle – Sequence of connected nodes; a cycle returns to the start.

Connected Components – Subgraphs where all nodes are reachable.

Weighted Graphs – Edges have weights (cost, distance, similarity).

Directed vs. Undirected – One-way vs. two-way connections.



---

Why It’s Used in ML

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) – Learn from structured, relational data.

Recommendation Systems – Use user–item interaction graphs.

Fraud Detection – Identify suspicious patterns in transaction graphs.

Semi-Supervised Learning – Label propagation across connected data.



---

Sample Problem

You have a social network with nodes as users and edges as friendships.
You want to:

1. Predict who might become friends next (link prediction).


2. Recommend connections using graph embeddings like Node2Vec.




---

Applications

NLP – Knowledge graphs for question answering.

Computer Vision – Scene graph generation.

Chemistry – Predict molecular properties from atom–bond graphs.

E-commerce – Personalized recommendations using interaction graphs.

13. Game Theory for AI & ML

What It Is

Game theory is the study of strategic interactions between multiple decision-makers (players), where each player’s outcome depends on their own actions and the actions of others.
In ML, it's used for:

Multi-agent systems

Adversarial training (like GANs)

Economics & auctions

Strategic resource allocation



---

Key Concepts

Player – Decision-making entity.

Strategy – A plan of action.

Payoff – Reward or loss from a strategy outcome.

Nash Equilibrium – A state where no player can improve their payoff by changing only their own strategy.

Zero-Sum Game – One player’s gain is another’s loss.

Cooperative vs. Non-Cooperative – Players may work together or act selfishly.

Dominant Strategy – Always best regardless of others’ choices.



---

Why It’s Used in ML

Reinforcement Learning – Multi-agent environments.

GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) – Generator vs discriminator is a two-player zero-sum game.

Auction Algorithms – Pricing strategies in recommender systems.

Security & Defense AI – Optimal defense strategies under adversaries.



---

Sample Problem

Two self-driving cars approach a narrow bridge from opposite ends.

Both can choose Yield or Go.

If both Go → collision (big loss).

If one Yields and one Goes → the Go car wins time, the Yield car loses time.

The optimal strategy may require mixed strategies for safety.



---

Applications

Adversarial ML – Model robustness against attacks.

Economics – Dynamic pricing, bidding systems.

Robotics – Multi-robot coordination.

Network Security – Defending against strategic hackers.
