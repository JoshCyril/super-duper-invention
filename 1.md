üîß LLM Prompt to Generate vault.yml:

> I want to build a structured personal knowledge graph using the following vault.yml format.
Please create a YAML object that:

Has a root vault name (e.g., "LearnBlockchain")

Defines multiple folders and subfolders

Includes .md files in each folder

Each file contains 100‚Äì200 words of markdown content explaining the concept clearly

Files can link to each other using a links list (simulate wiki-style [[PageName]] references)

Add an optional folder_colors dictionary for customizing colors of folders in the graph

Generate this structure for the topic: "Learn Blockchain Basics"

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not exceed 200 words per content field. Use simple, clear, informative language.
Output only valid YAML following this exact format.

          - Consensus.md

      - name: Consensus.md
        content: |
          Consensus algorithms ensure all participants in a blockchain network agree on the state of the ledger. Common types include Proof of Work and Proof of Stake.
